Design and Simulation of PID Controllers for Motor Speed Control

Welcome to the "Design and Simulation of PID Controllers for Motor Speed Control" project! This repository contains the  models, and documentation for designing and simulating Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers aimed at motor speed control.
A PID Controller stands for Proportional, Integral, and Derivative Controller. Itâ€™s a control loop feedback mechanism (or controller) widely used in industrial control systems. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value as the difference between a desired value also called a reference point and a measured process variable and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms, hence the name. For this reason, a PID Controller can be applied as a Control Logic in several situations, and a Motor Controller can use PID in order to reduce the error of critical aspects such as Current, Speed, and Position.
